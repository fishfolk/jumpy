Once implemented, the rest of the trait provides default implementations for generating all integer types, though it is not recommended to override these."],["SecureCore","A marker trait to be applied to anything that implements [`TurboCore`] in order to indicate that a PRNG source is cryptographically secure, so being a CSPRNG."],["SeededCore","Trait for implementing Seedable PRNGs, requiring that the PRNG implements [`TurboCore`] as a baseline. Seeds must be `Sized` in order to be used as the internal state of a PRNG."],["TurboCore","Base trait for implementing a PRNG. Only one method must be implemented: [`TurboCore::fill_bytes`], which provides the basis for any PRNG, to fill a buffer of bytes with random data."],["TurboRand","Extension trait for automatically implementing all [`TurboRand`] methods, as long as the struct implements [`TurboCore`] & [`GenCore`]. All methods are provided as default implementations that build on top of [`TurboCore`] and [`GenCore`], and thus are not recommended to be overridden, lest you potentially change the expected outcome of the methods."]]};
