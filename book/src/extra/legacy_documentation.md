# Legacy Documentation

After the Bevy rewrite, the Jumpy book was revised, but not all of the old pages have been migrated
to the new revision.

The legacy documentation can still be read [here](https://fishfolk.github.io/jumpy-legacy-docs/),
and while much of it is now out of date, some of the pages still have useful thoughts, and may be
good to migrate to this book.
