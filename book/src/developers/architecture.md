# Architecture

The Jumpy architecture is documented in the project [Rustdoc](./rustdoc/jumpy/index.html).

Our Rustdoc isn't just API documentation, but also includes guide-level explanations of various
aspects of the game, such as networking. It's the best way to get in deep and understand how the
game is put together from a code perspective.
